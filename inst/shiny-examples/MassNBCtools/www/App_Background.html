<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards (SWQS) (314 Code of
Massachusetts Regulations (CMR) 4.00) are the foundation of the state’s
water quality management program. This regulation defines the most
sensitive uses for surface waters, prescribes minimum water quality
criteria to sustain those uses, and protects existing uses and
high-quality waters. However, the SWQS state that waters exhibiting
excursions from criteria solely due to natural background conditions are
not interpreted as violations of water quality standards (per 314 CMR
4.03(5)). In addition, at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e)1.: Generally Applicable
Criteria, the SWQS state that “[f]or each pollutant identified in 314
CMR 4.06(6)(d): Table 29: Generally Applicable Criteria, the
concentrations identified or calculated for that pollutant in or
pursuant to Table 29 shall be generally applicable criteria for all
categories of surface waters, as specified therein; unless the
Department determines that naturally occurring background concentrations
are higher. Where the Department determines that naturally occurring
background concentrations are higher, those concentrations shall be the
allowable receiving water concentrations.” The SWQS define background
conditions as “water quality which exists or would exist in the absence
of pollutants requiring permits and other controllable cultural factors
that are subject to regulation under [Massachusetts General Laws] M.G.L.
c. 21, §§ 26 through 53” (314 CMR 4.02).</p>

<h2>Intended application</h2>
<p>Determining natural background conditions (NBC) is essential to
evaluate if surface water quality data represent violations of water
quality criteria in the SWQS. The purpose of this app is to provide
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) analysts
with a tool to determine whether measured exceedances of SWQS could be
due to NBC. The app walks the user through a serious of questions
designed to match Appendix A of the 2022 MassDEP CALM document. NBC
cannot be considered the cause of measured exceedances if anthropogenic
stressors dominate the landscape. Detailed instructions on how to use
the app are described below.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>The MassNBCtools app has a series of input tabs wherein the user
needs to respond to prompts (see Natural Background Evaluation). The
“Input: Land Evaluation” tab is where the user should begin. This tab
contains questions that prompt the user to evaluate a specific AU and
determine whether anthropogenic land cover/land use may be present.
Appendix A of the 2022 MassDEP CALM indicates that extensive
anthropogenic stressors will disqualify an AU from being considered for
NBC. Beyond the land evaluation tabs are additional parameter-specific
tabs. These tabs correspond with the parameter-specific questions
described in Appendix A of the 2022 MassDEP CALM. Note, that these
parameter-specific tabs may not need to be evaluated if an AU is already
excluded from NBC considerations given the presence of anthropogenic
stressors.</p>
