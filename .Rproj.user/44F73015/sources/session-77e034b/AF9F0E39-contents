## Background

The Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards (SWQS)
(314 Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR) 4.00) are the foundation of the
state\'s water quality management program. The regulation defines the most
sensitive uses for surface waters, prescribes minimum water quality criteria to
sustain those uses, and protects existing uses and high-quality waters. The
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) establishes criteria in the SWQS to protect the most sensitive uses; however, the SWQS state that waters exhibiting excursions from criteria solely due to natural background
conditions are not interpreted as violations of water quality standards (per
314 CMR 4.03(5)). In addition, at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e)1.: Generally Applicable
Criteria, the SWQS state that \"[f]or each pollutant identified in 314 CMR
4.06(6)(d): Table 29: Generally Applicable Criteria, the concentrations
identified or calculated for that pollutant in or pursuant to Table 29 shall be
generally applicable criteria for all categories of surface waters, as
specified therein; unless the Department determines that naturally occurring
background concentrations are higher. Where the Department determines that
naturally occurring background concentrations are higher, those concentrations
shall be the allowable receiving water concentrations.\" The SWQS define
background conditions as \"water quality which exists or would exist in the
absence of pollutants requiring permits and other controllable cultural factors
that are subject to regulation under [Massachusetts General Laws] M.G.L.
c. 21, §§ 26 through 53\" (314 CMR 4.02). Natural background condition
determinations are an essential part of evaluating whether surface waters are
meeting standards. These determinations require review of many sources of
information; therefore, MassDEP developed a tool to increase the efficiency and
consistency of these determinations.

## Natural Background Conditions (NBC) Screening Tool

This RShiny NBC Screening Tool application (app) (*MassNBCtools*) is
intended to help assessment staff evaluate whether natural background
conditions (NBC) likely contribute to excursions of SWQS criteria. The
app walks the user through a series of questions concerning anthropogenic
stressors since certain levels of stress preemptively disqualifies an Assessment
Unit (AU) from NBC consideration (when anthropogenic stressors dominate
the landscape exceedances of criteria cannot be attributed solely due to NBC).
Detailed instructions on how to use the app are described below.

## Instructions

The MassNBCtools app walks the user through a series of
input tabs wherein the user reviews AU-specific data and responds to a standardized series of questions. To begin, click on the *Natural Background
Evaluation* tab, after which a drop-down menu will appear. Below are
detailed instructions for each tab. Note, that all outputs from all input tabs
are stored in the *Output: Results and Download* tab.

#### *Input: Land Evaluation*

The *Input: Land Evaluation* tab is where the user should begin their assessment of an AU for NBC. This tab contains questions that prompt the user to evaluate a specific AU and determine whether anthropogenic land cover/land use may result in SWQS exceedance(s) or excursion(s). Extensive anthropogenic stressors preemptively disqualify an AU from NBC consideration.

It may take 10-15 seconds for the table and map to appear (Figure 1). Analysts input their name in the *Analyst Name* box and then type the number of the AU into the \"Assessment Unit (AU)\" box (do not search for the AU in the drop-down menu as it is limited). After entering an AU, the table and map will automatically filter to that AU. The table contains basic information about the AU including any applicable qualifiers from the SWQS and land use percentages. Note, you have to scroll to see all available columns. To scroll, click on the table and use the right arrow on the keyboard. Use the map, table, and help text to answer the subsequent questions. Type any additional notes or observations in the *General Notes* box. Use the blue buttons to download the map or the entire webpage.

Beyond the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab are additional parameter-specific tabs. Note, parameter-specific tabs can be skipped if an AU is already excluded from NBC consideration from the land evaluation.

#### ***Input: Temperature***

The *Input: Temperature* tab is where the user evaluates water temperature exceedances (Figure 2). The analyst must first type an AU in the *Input: Land
Evaluation* tab, which populates the *Chosen AU* and *AU Temperature Class Qualifier* fields. Helper information is also provided for the impervious land cover question. Answer subsequent questions for the continuous and/or discrete water temperature data.

#### ***Input: Dissolved Oxygen***

The *Input: Dissolved Oxygen* tab is where the user evaluates dissolved oxygen (DO) exceedances (Figure 3). An AU must first be chosen in the *Input: Land
Evaluation* tab, which populates the *Chosen AU* field. Helper information is also provided for the wetland land cover question. Answer subsequent questions for the continuous and/or discrete DO data.

#### ***Input: Total Phosphorus***

The *Input: Total Phosphorus* tab is where the user evaluates total phosphorus (TP) exceedances (Figure 4). An AU must first be chosen in the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab, which populates the *Chosen AU* field. While MassDEP does not have numeric nutrient criteria, published research indicates that phosphorus is naturally derived from the weathering of phosphorus-rich minerals. Therefore, information for the user is provided to assess whether high TP concentrations may be due to the lithology and surficial geology underlying the chosen AU.

#### ***Input: pH***

The *Input: pH* tab is where the user evaluates pH exceedances (Figure 5). An AU
must first be chosen in the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab, which populates the *Chosen AU* field. Published research indicates that pH is lower in wetland-dominated systems than those systems without wetlands. Analysts must answer the subsequent question using helper information (the MassDEP SWQS pH criteria are included for quick reference).

#### *Input: Metals*

The *Input: Metals* tab is where the user evaluates metals exceedances (Figure 6). An AU must first be chosen in the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab, which populates the *Chosen AU* field. Published research indicates that metals are naturally derived from the weathering of metal-rich minerals. Information for the user is provided to assess whether metals concentrations are likely due to the lithology and surficial geology underlying the chosen AU. These can be compared to metals criteria outlined in the SWQS.

#### ***Output: Results and Download***

The *Output: Results and Download* tab is where the results from the various input tabs are compiled (Figure 6). As the analyst inputs the AU and answers the land evaluation and parameter-specific questions the output tab is automatically populated. Blanks in the *Output: Results and Download* tab indicate specific questions were not answered. Use the blue button to download a screenshot of the results (Figure 7).
