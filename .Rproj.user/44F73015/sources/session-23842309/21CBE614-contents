## Background

The Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards (SWQS) (314 Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR) 4.00) are the foundation of the state's water quality management program. This regulation defines the most sensitive uses for surface waters, prescribes minimum water quality criteria to sustain those uses, and protects existing uses and high-quality waters. However, the SWQS state that waters exhibiting excursions from criteria solely due to natural background conditions are not interpreted as violations of water quality standards (per 314 CMR 4.03(5)). In addition, at 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e)1.: Generally Applicable Criteria, the SWQS state that "[f]or each pollutant identified in 314 CMR 4.06(6)(d): Table 29: Generally Applicable Criteria, the concentrations identified or calculated for that pollutant in or pursuant to Table 29 shall be generally applicable criteria for all categories of surface waters, as specified therein; unless the Department determines that naturally occurring background concentrations are higher. Where the Department determines that naturally occurring background concentrations are higher, those concentrations shall be the allowable receiving water concentrations." The SWQS define background conditions as "water quality which exists or would exist in the absence of pollutants requiring permits and other controllable cultural factors that are subject to regulation under [Massachusetts General Laws] M.G.L. c. 21, §§ 26 through 53" (314 CMR 4.02).

## Intended application

Determining natural background conditions (NBC) is essential to evaluate if surface water quality data represent violations of water quality criteria in the SWQS. The purpose of this app is to provide Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) analysts with a tool to determine whether measured violations of SWQS could be due to NBC. The app walks the user through a series of questions designed to match Appendix A of the 2022 MassDEP CALM document. NBC cannot be considered the cause of measured violations if anthropogenic stressors dominate the landscape. Detailed instructions on how to use the app are described below.

## Instructions

The MassNBCtools app is designed to walk the user through a series of input tabs wherein the user needs to review AU-specific data and respond to various questions. To begin, click on the *Natural Background Evaluation* tab, after which a drop-down menu will appear. Below are detailed instructions for each tab. Note, that all outputs from all input tabs are stored in the *Output: Results and Download* tab.

#### *Input: Land Evaluation*

The *Input: Land Evaluation* tab is where the user should begin their assessment of an AU for NBC. This tab contains questions that prompt the user to evaluate a specific AU and determine whether anthropogenic land cover/land use may be the cause of measured SWQS violations. Appendix A of the 2022 MassDEP CALM indicates that extensive anthropogenic stressors will disqualify an AU from being considered for NBC.

First, wait for the table and map to appear (\~10-15 seconds) (Figure 1). Then, input your name in the *Analyst Name* box. Next, select an AU from the *Assessment Unit (AU)* drop-down menu. We recommend that you begin to type the AU name rather than search for it in the menu. After selecting an AU, the table and map will automatically filter to that AU. Note, that there are more table columns than visible on the screen. To scroll, click on the table and use the right arrow on the keyboard. Use the map, table, and help text to answer the subsequent questions. Reference the 2022 MassDEP CALM as necessary. Type any additional observations in the *General Notes* box. Use the blue buttons to download the map or the entire webpage.

Beyond the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab are additional parameter-specific tabs. Note, that the parameter-specific tabs can be skipped if an AU is excluded from NBC considerations due to the presence of anthropogenic stressors.

#### ***Input: Temperature***

The *Input: Temperature* tab is where the user evaluates water temperature violations (Figure 2). An AU must first be chosen in the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab. Once chosen, the *Chosen AU* and *AU Temperature Class Qualifier* fields will be populated. Answer the subsequent questions using continuous and/or discrete water temperature data. Helper information is provided for the impervious land cover question after an AU is chosen.

#### ***Input: Dissolved Oxygen***

The *Input: Dissolved Oxygen* tab is where the user evaluates dissolved oxygen (DO) violations (Figure 3). An AU must first be chosen in the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab. Once chosen, the *Chosen AU* field will be populated. Answer the subsequent questions using continuous and/or discrete DO data. Helper information is provided for the wetland land cover question after an AU is chosen.

#### ***Input: Total Phosphorus***

The *Input: Total Phosphorus* tab is where the user evaluates total phosphorus (TP) violations (Figure 4). An AU must first be chosen in the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab. Once chosen, the *Chosen AU* field will be populated. Currently, MassDEP does not have numeric nutrient criteria, nor does the 2022 MassDEP CALM Appendix A consider natural sources of TP. However, published research indicates that phosphorus is naturally derived from the weathering of phosphorus-rich minerals. Therefore, we provide information for the user to assess whether high TP concentrations are due to the lithology and surficial geology underlying the chosen AU.

#### ***Input: pH***

The *Input: pH* tab is where the user evaluates pH violations (Figure 5). An AU must first be chosen in the *Input: Land Evaluation* tab. Once chosen, the *Chosen AU* field will be populated. Currently, the 2022 MassDEP CALM Appendix A does not consider natural sources of pH excursions. However, published research indicates that pH is lower in wetland-dominated systems than those systems without wetlands. Answer the subsequent question using the helper information (after an AU is chosen). We included the MassDEP SWQS for pH as a reference.

#### ***Output: Results and Download***

The *Output: Results and Download* tab is where the results from the various input tabs are compiled (Figure 6). The tab will be populated as an AU is chosen and the land evaluation and parameter-specific questions are answered. Blanks in the *Output: Results and Download* tab indicate that the specific question was not answered. Use the blue button to download a screenshot of the results.

## Maintenance Log

The following table contains all of the files that support this app. Check this table to confirm the last time a file has been updated.

```{r table_1}

# state directories
table.dir <- "Tables"
table.file <- "Maintenance_Log.xlsx"
tab1.dir <- "Log"

table1 <- read_excel(file.path(table.dir, table.file), sheet = tab1.dir
                     , na = c("NA", ""), trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 0
                     , col_names = TRUE)
